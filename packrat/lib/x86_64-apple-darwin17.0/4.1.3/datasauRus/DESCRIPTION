Description: The Datasaurus Dozen is a set of datasets with the same
    summary statistics. They retain the same summary statistics despite
    having radically different distributions. The datasets represent a
    larger and quirkier object lesson that is typically taught via
    Anscombe's Quartet (available in the 'datasets' package).
    Anscombe's Quartet contains four very different distributions with
    the same summary statistics and as such highlights the value of
    visualisation in understanding data, over and above summary
    statistics. As well as being an engaging variant on the Quartet,
    the data is generated in a novel way. The simulated annealing
    process used to derive datasets from the original Datasaurus is
    detailed in "Same Stats, Different Graphs: Generating Datasets with
    Varied Appearance and Identical Statistics through Simulated
    Annealing" <doi:10.1145/3025453.3025912>.
