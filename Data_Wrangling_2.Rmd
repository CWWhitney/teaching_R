### Notes on tidy R

![](images/tidyR.png){width=1in}

Keep it tidy

If you are following this tutorial by running the code on your local machine (recomended) then it may make sense to check your R version by running the following code in the R console: `version`. At the time of writing this I am using R version 4.0.4 'Lost Library Book' [@R-base]. if you do not have this version or something newer it may make sense to update so that you can follow long.

The easiest way to get libraries for today is to install the whole tidyverse [@R-tidyverse] by typing `install.packages("tidyverse)` in the R console and then running `library(tidyverse)`:

http://style.tidyverse.org/

### Notes on tidy R browseVignettes

![](images/tidyR.png){width=1in}

Keep it tidy

Get a lot of examples and details about the tidyverse by running the following code in the R console: `browseVignettes(package = "tidyverse")`. Nearly every R library has a collection of vignettes that walk through examples and show, often in explicit detail, the authors intended use of the library.
 
### The tidy tools manifesto

In this tutorial we will be following the basic ideas behind the tidyverse.

### Notes on R: tidyR process

![](images/tidyR.png){width=1in}

Keep it tidy

![](images/tidyR_process.png){width=5in}

- Good coding style is like correct punctuation:
- withoutitthingsarehardtoread
 
- When your data is tidy, each column is a variable, and each row is an observation
- Consistent structure lets you focus your struggle on questions about the data, not fighting to get the data into the right form for different functions

### Notes on R: Tidy Data

Three things make a dataset tidy:
- Each variable with its own column.
- Each observation with its own row.
- Each value with its own cell.

![](images/tidydata.png){width=5in}

Read more about this from [Wickham's paper](www.jstatsoft.org/v59/i10/paper) in the Journal of Statistical Software.

### Wrangling: transform

- Once you have __tidy__ data, a common first step is to __transform__ it
- narrowing in on observations of interest
- creating new variables that are functions of existing variables
- calculating a set of summary statistics

### Wrangling: dplyr arguments

Format of __dplyr__ 

![](images/dplyr.png){width=1in} 

Arguments start with a data frame

- __select__: return a subset of the columns
- __filter__: extract a subset of rows
- __rename__: rename variables
- __mutate__: add new variables and columns or transform
- __group_by__: split data into groups
- __summarize__: generate tables of summary statistics

https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/

### Getting your data in R

Load data 

![](images/R_logo.png){width=1in}

- Load the data using the `read.csv` function

```{r wrangle2-participants-data}
participants_data <- read.csv("participants_data.csv")
```

- View the full data 

```{r wrangle2-names_participants-data}
participants_data
```

- Look at the top rows of the data with the `head` function. The default of the `head` function is to show 6 rows. This can be changed with the `n` argument.

```{r wrangle2-head-participants-data, excercize = TRUE}
# Change the number of rows displayed to 7
head(participants_data, 
     n = 4)
```

```{r wrangle2-head-participants-data-solution}
head(participants_data, 
     n = 7)
```

- Check the names of the variables in the data with the `names` function

```{r wrangle2-names-participants-data}
names(participants_data)
```

- Look at the structure of the data with the `str` function

```{r wrangle2-str-participants-data}
str(participants_data)
```

- Call a particular variable in your data with `$` 
```{r wrangle2-call-variable, excercize = TRUE}
# Change the variable to gender
participants_data$age
```

```{r wrangle2-call-variable-solution}
participants_data$gender
```

Follow these steps to see the result of the rest of the transformations we perform with `tidyverse`.

Learn more about what this function does by typing `?read.csv` in the R console.

- Keep your data in the same folder structure as .RProj
- at or below the level of .RProj

### Wrangling: dplyr library

Using __dplyr__ ![](images/dplyr.png){width=1in}

Load the dplyr library by running `library(dplyr)` in the R console. do the same for other libraries we need today `library(tidyr)` and `library(magrittr)` [@R-tidyr, @R-magrittr, @R-dplyr].

Inspiration for many of the following materials comes from Roger Peng's [dplyr tutorial](genomicsclass.github.io/book/pages/dplyr_tutorial).

# Change the selection to batch and age
select(participants_data, 
       academic_parents,
       working_hours_per_day)

# Change the selection 
# without batch and age
select(participants_data,
       -academic_parents,
       -working_hours_per_day)
```

```{r wrangle2-select-non-aca-parents-solution}
select(participants_data, 
       -batch, 
       -age)
```

https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/

### Wrangling: dplyr::filter work_filter

Subsetting ![](images/dplyr.png){width=1in}

__Filter__

Try creating a subset of the data with the `filter` function:

```{r wrangle2-filter-work, exercise=TRUE}
# Change the selection to 
# those who work more than 5 hours a day
filter(participants_data, 
       working_hours_per_day >10)
```

```{r wrangle2-filter-work-solution}
filter(participants_data, 
       working_hours_per_day >5)
```

https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/

### Wrangling: dplyr::filter work_name_filter

Subsetting ![](images/dplyr.png){width=1in}

  __Filter__

Try creating a subset of the data with the `filter` function:

```{r wrangle2-filter-work-name, exercise=TRUE}
# Change the filter to those who 
# work more than 5 hours a day and 
# names are longer than three letters
filter(participants_data, 
       working_hours_per_day >10 & 
         letters_in_first_name >6)
```

```{r wrangle2-filter-work-name-solution}
filter(participants_data, 
       working_hours_per_day >5 & 
         letters_in_first_name >3)
```

https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/

### Wrangling: dplyr::rename name_length

 __Rename__  ![](images/dplyr.png){width=1in}

Change the names of the variables in the data with the `rename` function:

```{r wrangle2-rename-letters, exercise=TRUE}
# Rename the variable km_home_to_zef as commute
rename(participants_data, 
       name_length = letters_in_first_name)
```

```{r wrangle2-rename-letters-solution}
rename(participants_data, 
       commute = km_home_to_zef)
```

https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/

### Wrangling: dplyr::mutate

 __Mutate__  ![](images/dplyr.png){width=1in}

```{r wrangle2-rename-work, exercise=TRUE}
# Mutate a new column named age_mean that is a function of the age multiplied by the mean of all ages in the group
mutate(participants_data, 
       labor_mean = working_hours_per_day*
              mean(working_hours_per_day))
```

```{r wrangle2-rename-work-solution}
mutate(participants_data, 
       age_mean = age*
         mean(age))
```

https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/  

### Wrangling: dplyr::mutate

 __Mutate__  ![](images/dplyr.png){width=1in}

Create a commute category with the `mutate` function:

```{r wrangle2-mutate-commute, exercise=TRUE}
# Mutate new column named response_speed 
# populated by 'slow' if it took you 
# more than a day to answer my email and 
# 'fast' for others
mutate(participants_data, 
       commute = 
         ifelse(km_home_to_zef > 10, 
                 "commuter", "local"))
```

```{r wrangle2-mutate-commute-solution}
mutate(participants_data, 
       response_speed = 
         ifelse(days_to_email_response > 1, 
                        "slow", "fast"))
```

https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/  

### Wrangling: dplyr::summarize

 __Summarize__  
 
 ![](images/dplyr.png){width=1in} 
 
 Get a summary of travel times and days to response

```{r wrangle2-summar-commute, exercise=TRUE}
# Create a summary of the participants_mutate data 
# with the mean number of siblings 
# and median years of study
summarize(participants_data,
          mean(years_of_study),
          median(letters_in_first_name))
```

```{r wrangle2-summar-commute-solution}
summarize(participants_data,
          mean(number_of_siblings),
          median(years_of_study))
```

### Wrangling: magrittr use

  __Pipeline %>%__ 

- Do all the previous with a `magrittr` pipeline %>%. Use the `group_by` function to get these results for comparison between groups.

```{r wrangle2-pipe-long, exercise=TRUE}
# Use the magrittr pipe to summarize 
# the mean days to email response, 
# median letters in first name, 
# and maximum years of study by gender
participants_data %>% 
  group_by(research_continent) %>% 
  summarize(mean(days_to_email_response), 
            median(letters_in_first_name), 
            max(years_of_study))
```

```{r wrangle2-pipe-long-solution}
participants_data %>% 
  group_by(gender) %>% 
  summarize(mean(days_to_email_response), 
            median(letters_in_first_name), 
            max(years_of_study))
```

Now use the `mutate` function to subset the data and use the `group_by` function to get these results for comparisons between groups.

```{r wrangle2-pipe-long2, exercise=TRUE}
# Use the magrittr pipe to create a new column 
# called commute, where those who travel 
# more than 10km to get to the office 
# are called "commuter" and others are "local". 
# Summarize the mean days to email response, 
# median letters in first name, 
# and maximum years of study. 
participants_data %>% 
   mutate(response_speed = ifelse(
     days_to_email_response > 1, 
     "slow", "fast")) %>% 
  group_by(response_speed) %>% 
  summarize(mean(number_of_siblings), 
            median(years_of_study), 
            max(letters_in_first_name))
```

```{r wrangle2-pipe-long2-solution}
participants_data %>% 
   mutate(commute = ifelse(
     km_home_to_zef > 10, 
     "commuter", "local")) %>% 
  group_by(commute) %>% 
  summarize(mean(days_to_email_response), 
            median(letters_in_first_name), 
            max(years_of_study))
```

### purrr: Apply a function to each element of a vector

![](images/purrr.jpg){width=4in}

We will use the `purrr` library to run a regression [@R-purrr]. Run the code `library(purrr)` in your local R console to load the library.

![](images/purrr.jpg){width=1in}
Now we will use the `purrr` library for a simple linear regression [@R-purr]. Note that when using base R functions with the `magrittr` pipeline we use '.' to refer to the data.  The functions `split` and `lm` are from base R and stats packages [@R-base, @R-stats].

Use purrr to solve: split a data frame into pieces, fit a model to each piece, compute the summary, then extract the R^2.

```{r wrangle2-purr-regression, exercise=TRUE}
# Split the data frame by batch, 
# fit a linear model formula 
# (days to email response as dependent 
# and working hours as independent) 
# to each batch, compute the summary, 
# then extract the R^2.
participants_data_regression <- 
    participants_data %>%
      split(.$gender) %>% 
        map(~ 
          lm(number_of_publications ~ 
                number_of_siblings, 
                 data = .)) %>%
  map(summary) %>%
  map_dbl("r.squared")
```

```{r wrangle2-purr-regression-solution}
participants_data_regression <- 
    participants_data %>%
      split(.$batch) %>% # from base R
        map(~ 
          lm(days_to_email_response ~ 
                working_hours_per_day, 
                 data = .)) %>%
  map(summary) %>%
  map_dbl("r.squared")
```

### Tasks for the afternoon: Advanced

![](images/tidyR.png){width=1in}
![](images/dplyr.png){width=1in}
![](images/magrittr.png){width=1in}

Work through tasks on the diamonds data in long format in base and short format with magrittr pipeline:

- select: carat and price
- filter: only where carat is > 0.5
- rename: rename price as cost
- mutate: name expensive or cheap if greater than mean of price/cost
- group_by: split into cheap and expensive
- summarize: give some summary statistics of your choice
