### Notes on tidy R

![](images/tidyR.png){width=1in}

Keep it tidy

If you are following this tutorial by running the code on your local machine (recommended) then it may make sense to check your R version by running the following code in your R console: 

```{r example-version, exercise=TRUE}
version
```  

At the time of writing this I am using R version 4.0.4 `Lost Library Book` [@R-base]. If you do not have this version or something newer it may make sense to update so that you can follow along without pesky version issues.

The easiest way to get libraries for today is to install the whole tidyverse [@R-tidyverse] by typing `install.packages("tidyverse")` in the R console and then running `library(tidyverse)`:

```
install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
```  

If you save your work to an .R file (recommended) be sure to annotate any code that you do not intend to run each time with the `#` symbol. You should only need to install tidyverse once and should be sure to either change that line of code to `#install.packages("tidyverse")` or remove it from your script. 

Read more style tips in the [tidyverse style guide](http://style.tidyverse.org/) [@R-tidyverse].

### Notes on tidy R browseVignettes

![](images/tidyR.png){width=1in}

Keep it tidy

Get a lot of examples and details about the tidyverse by running the following code in the R console: `browseVignettes(package = "tidyverse")`. Nearly every R library has a collection of vignettes that walk through examples and show, often in explicit detail, the authors intended use of the library.
 
### The tidy tools manifesto

In this tutorial we will be following the basic ideas behind the tidyverse.

### Notes on R: tidyR process

![](images/tidyR.png){width=1in}

Keep it tidy

![](images/tidyR_process.png){width=4in}

- Good coding style is like correct punctuation:
- withoutitthingsarehardtoread
- When your data is tidy, each column is a variable, and each row is an observation
- Consistent structure lets you focus your struggle on questions about the data, not fighting to get the data into the right form for different functions

![](images/wrangler.png){width=2in}

Read more style tipes in the [tidyverse style guide](http://style.tidyverse.org/) [@R-tidyverse].

### Notes on R: Tidy Data

Three things make a dataset tidy:

- Each variable with its own column.
- Each observation with its own row.
- Each value with its own cell.

![](images/tidydata.png){width=5in}

Read more about this from [Wickham's paper](www.jstatsoft.org/v59/i10/paper) in the Journal of Statistical Software.

### Wrangling: transform

- Once you have __tidy__ data, a common first step is to __transform__ it
- narrowing in on observations of interest
- creating new variables that are functions of existing variables
- calculating a set of summary statistics

### Wrangling: dplyr arguments

Format of __dplyr__ 

![](images/dplyr.png){width=1in} 

Arguments start with a data frame

- __select__: return a subset of the columns
- __filter__: extract a subset of rows
- __rename__: rename variables
- __mutate__: add new variables and columns or transform
- __group_by__: split data into groups
- __summarize__: generate tables of summary statistics

https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/

### Getting your data in R

Load data 

![](images/R_logo.png){width=1in}

- Load the data using the `read.csv` function

```
# Use this on your machine
participants_data <- read.csv("participants_data.csv")
```

Learn more about what this function does by typing `?read.csv` in the R console.

You can also get the data from this Github repository by using the `read_csv` function from the `readr` library [@R-readr] and `url` function from base R.  In this case you will want to use the 'save as' option for the webpage so that you can have it stored locally as a `comma separated values` (.csv) file on your machine.

```{r wrangle2-git-data, exercise=TRUE}
library(readr)

urlfile = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CWWhitney/teaching_R/master/participants_data.csv"

participants_data <- read_csv(url(urlfile))
```

- Keep your data in the same folder structure as .RProj
- at or below the level of .RProj

### Looking at the data

- View the full data in the console (see the `View` function to see it in the Rstudio 'Environment')

```{r wrangle2-names_participants-data, exercise=TRUE}
participants_data
```

- Look at the top rows of the data with the `head` function. The default of the `head` function is to show 6 rows. This can be changed with the `n` argument.

```{r wrangle2-head-participants-data, exercise=TRUE}
# Change the number of rows displayed to 7
head(participants_data, 
     n = 4)
```

```{r wrangle2-head-participants-data-hint-1}
# use the ?head option to learn the details of the function
?head
```

```{r wrangle2-head-participants-data-hint-2}
# look at the 'Arguments' section for the 'n' argument
?head
```

```{r wrangle2-head-participants-data-hint-3}
# The 'n' argument should be changed from 'n = 4' to 'n = 7'
head(participants_data, 
     n = 7)
```

```{r wrangle2-head-participants-data-solution}
head(participants_data, 
     n = 7)
```

- Check the names of the variables in the data with the `names` function

```{r wrangle2-names-participants-data, exercise=TRUE}
names(participants_data)
```

- Look at the structure of the data with the `str` function

```{r wrangle2-str-participants-data, exercise=TRUE}
str(participants_data)
```

- Call a particular variable in your data with `$` 

```{r wrangle2-call-variable, exercise=TRUE}
# Change the variable to gender
participants_data$age
```

```{r wrangle2-call-variable-solution}
participants_data$gender
```

Follow these steps to see the result of the rest of the transformations we perform with `tidyverse`.

### Wrangling: dplyr library

Using __dplyr__ ![](images/dplyr.png){width=1in}

Load the dplyr library by running `library(dplyr)` in the R console. do the same for other libraries we need today `library(tidyr)` and `library(magrittr)` [@R-tidyr, @R-magrittr, @R-dplyr].

Inspiration for many of the following materials comes from Roger Peng's [dplyr tutorial](genomicsclass.github.io/book/pages/dplyr_tutorial).  

![](images/github.png){width=1in}

Read more about the [dplyr library](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) [@R-dplyr].

### Wrangling: dplyr::select aca_work_set

Subsetting 

![](images/dplyr.png){width=1in}

__Select__

Create a subset of the data with the `select` function:

```{r wrangle2-select-aca-parents, exercise=TRUE}
# Change the selection to batch and age
select(participants_data, 
       academic_parents,
       working_hours_per_day)
```

```{r wrangle2-select-aca-parents-solution}

```

https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/

### Wrangling: dplyr::select non_aca_work_filter

Subsetting ![](images/dplyr.png){width=1in}

__Select__

Try creating a subset of the data with the `select` function:

```{r wrangle2-select-non-aca-parents, exercise=TRUE}
# Change the selection 
# without batch and age
select(participants_data,
       -academic_parents,
       -working_hours_per_day)
```

```{r wrangle2-select-non-aca-parents-solution}
select(participants_data, 
       -batch, 
       -age)
```

https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/

### Wrangling: dplyr::filter work_filter

Subsetting ![](images/dplyr.png){width=1in}

__Filter__

Try creating a subset of the data with the `filter` function:

```{r wrangle2-filter-work, exercise=TRUE}
# Change the selection to 
# those who work more than 5 hours a day
filter(participants_data, 
       working_hours_per_day >10)
```

```{r wrangle2-filter-work-solution}
filter(participants_data, 
       working_hours_per_day >5)
```

https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/

### Wrangling: dplyr::filter work_name_filter

Subsetting ![](images/dplyr.png){width=1in}

  __Filter__

Create a subset of the data with multiple options in the `filter` function:

```{r wrangle2-filter-work-name, exercise=TRUE}
# Change the filter to those who 
# work more than 5 hours a day and 
# names are longer than three letters
filter(participants_data, 
       working_hours_per_day >10 & 
         letters_in_first_name >6)
```

```{r wrangle2-filter-work-name-solution}
filter(participants_data, 
       working_hours_per_day >5 & 
         letters_in_first_name >3)
```

https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/

### Wrangling: dplyr::rename name_length

 __Rename__  ![](images/dplyr.png){width=1in}

Change the names of the variables in the data with the `rename` function:

```{r wrangle2-rename-letters, exercise=TRUE}
# Rename the variable km_home_to_office as commute
rename(participants_data, 
       name_length = letters_in_first_name)
```

```{r wrangle2-rename-letters-solution}
rename(participants_data, 
       commute = km_home_to_office)
```

https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/

### Wrangling: dplyr::mutate

 __Mutate__  ![](images/dplyr.png){width=1in}

```{r wrangle2-rename-work, exercise=TRUE}
# Mutate a new column named age_mean that is a function of the age multiplied by the mean of all ages in the group
mutate(participants_data, 
       labor_mean = working_hours_per_day*
              mean(working_hours_per_day))
```

```{r wrangle2-rename-work-solution}
mutate(participants_data, 
       age_mean = age*
         mean(age))
```

https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/  

### Wrangling: dplyr::mutate

 __Mutate__  ![](images/dplyr.png){width=1in}

Create a commute category with the `mutate` function:

```{r wrangle2-mutate-commute, exercise=TRUE}
# Mutate new column named response_speed 
# populated by 'slow' if it took you 
# more than a day to answer my email and 
# 'fast' for others
mutate(participants_data, 
       commute = 
         ifelse(km_home_to_office > 10, 
                 "commuter", "local"))
```

```{r wrangle2-mutate-commute-solution}
mutate(participants_data, 
       response_speed = 
         ifelse(days_to_email_response > 1, 
                        "slow", "fast"))
```

https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/  

### Wrangling: dplyr::summarize

 __Summarize__  
 
 ![](images/dplyr.png){width=1in} 
 
Get a summary of selected variables with `summarize`

```{r wrangle2-summar-commute, exercise=TRUE}
# Create a summary of the participants_mutate data 
# with the mean number of siblings 
# and median years of study
summarize(participants_data,
          mean(years_of_study),
          median(letters_in_first_name))
```

```{r wrangle2-summar-commute-solution}
summarize(participants_data,
          mean(number_of_siblings),
          median(years_of_study))
```

### Wrangling: magrittr use

  __Pipeline %>%__ 

- Do all the previous with a `magrittr` pipeline %>%. Use the `group_by` function to get these results for comparison between groups.

```{r wrangle2-pipe-long, exercise=TRUE}
# Use the magrittr pipe to summarize 
# the mean days to email response, 
# median letters in first name, 
# and maximum years of study by gender
participants_data %>% 
  group_by(research_continent) %>% 
  summarize(mean(days_to_email_response), 
            median(letters_in_first_name), 
            max(years_of_study))
```

```{r wrangle2-pipe-long-solution}
participants_data %>% 
  group_by(gender) %>% 
  summarize(mean(days_to_email_response), 
            median(letters_in_first_name), 
            max(years_of_study))
```

Now use the `mutate` function to subset the data and use the `group_by` function to get these results for comparisons between groups.

```{r wrangle2-pipe-long2, exercise=TRUE}
# Use the magrittr pipe to create a new column 
# called commute, where those who travel 
# more than 10km to get to the office 
# are called "commuter" and others are "local". 
# Summarize the mean days to email response, 
# median letters in first name, 
# and maximum years of study. 
participants_data %>% 
   mutate(response_speed = ifelse(
     days_to_email_response > 1, 
     "slow", "fast")) %>% 
  group_by(response_speed) %>% 
  summarize(mean(number_of_siblings), 
            median(years_of_study), 
            max(letters_in_first_name))
```

```{r wrangle2-pipe-long2-solution}
participants_data %>% 
   mutate(commute = ifelse(
     km_home_to_office > 10, 
     "commuter", "local")) %>% 
  group_by(commute) %>% 
  summarize(mean(days_to_email_response), 
            median(letters_in_first_name), 
            max(years_of_study))
```

### purrr: Apply a function to each element of a vector

![](images/purrr.jpg){width=4in}

We will use the `purrr` library to run a regression [@R-purrr]. Run the code `library(purrr)` in your local R console to load the library.

![](images/purrr.jpg){width=1in}
Now we will use the `purrr` library for a simple linear regression [@R-purrr]. Note that when using base R functions with the `magrittr` pipeline we use '.' to refer to the data.  The functions `split` and `lm` are from base R and stats [@R-base].

Use purrr to solve: split a data frame into pieces, fit a model to each piece, compute the summary, then extract the R^2.

```{r wrangle2-purr-regression, exercise=TRUE}
# Split the data frame by batch, 
# fit a linear model formula 
# (days to email response as dependent 
# and working hours as independent) 
# to each batch, compute the summary, 
# then extract the R^2.
    participants_data %>%
      split(.$gender) %>% 
        map(~ 
          lm(number_of_publications ~ 
                number_of_siblings, 
                 data = .)) %>%
  map(summary) %>%
  map_dbl("r.squared")
```

```{r wrangle2-purr-regression-solution}
    participants_data %>%
      split(.$batch) %>% # from base R
        map(~ 
          lm(days_to_email_response ~ 
                working_hours_per_day, 
                 data = .)) %>%
  map(summary) %>%
  map_dbl("r.squared")
```

### Test your new skills

**Your turn to perform**

Up until this point the code has been provided for you to work on. Now it is time for you to apply your new found skills. Please work through the wrangling tasks we just went though. Use the `diamonds` data and make the steps in long format (i.e. assigning each step to an object) and short format with (i.e. with the magrittr pipeline):

- select: carat and price
- filter: only where carat is > 0.5
- rename: rename price as cost
- mutate: name expensive if greater than mean of price/cost or cheap otherwise
- group_by: split into cheap and expensive
- summarize: give some summary statistics of your choice

The diamonds data is built in with the `ggplot2` library. It is already available in your R environment. Look at the help file with `?diamonds` to learn more about it.
